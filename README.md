## 🪙 Smart Contract
The frontend interacts with your deployed Solidity smart contract using the **contract address** and **ABI** stored in `app.js`.

Make sure to:
1. Deploy your contract on a testnet (e.g., Sepolia or Goerli).  
2. Copy the contract address and ABI into `app.js`.  
3. Connect your MetaMask to the same network.
